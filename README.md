# URSA Driver Station

This app allows control of SERT's URSA (Headbot) robots. Currently, only Android
devices are fully supported. iOS and desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) should be
mostly functional with few changes. Due to the UDP connection used to
communicate with the robot, web is not currently supported.
