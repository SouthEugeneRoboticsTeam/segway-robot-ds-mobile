# URSA Simulator

This program simulates the high-level functionality of the [URSA robot](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/ursa).
It is intended to be used for testing the driver station software without the
need for a physical robot. Some functionality is limited, but it should be
enough to test most of the driver station software.

## Usage

```bash
python3 ursa.py --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 2521
```
